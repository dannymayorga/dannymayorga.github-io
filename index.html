          <p class="sectionSubtitle">Just a peek.</p>
          <p>I love music, especially the 80’s, alternative rock and electronic dance music. I'm a self-taught web &amp; ux designer and front-end developer (late nights that I'm thankful for). Consumer Behavior was my favorite core class in college. I'm a <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/" target="_blank">Bootstrap</a> enthusiast. I enjoy a cold glass of beer, whiskey, or cognac from time to time. Deserts are a weakness. I like wearing vintage design T-shirts, but I love wearing tailored suits.</p>
