        <p class="sectionSubtitle">Specializing in optimizing and enhacing user experiences for today's web &amp; mobile applications.</p>
        <p>Hello, I'm Danny Mayorga and currently the Web Product Manager and Web Team Manager at OpenEnglish.com and NextU.com. Open English is a leading education SaaS platform focused on English language learning for Latin America, Brazil, U.S. Hispanic, Spain, Turkey and Russia, enrolling over 500,000 students so far. NextU is a newly acquired SaaS platform to help students develop technology skills for their next steps in their career. Combined both websites accumulate over 2.1mil unique monthly visitors and offer students paths to change their lives.</p>
        <p>In the past decade, my path has brought me to focus on enhancing user experiences for web products and services for corporate and startup environments. After receiving a B.B.A, Marketing, I started my journey into the digital world as a freelancer which grew to Web Designer, UX Designer and Front-end developer. Now as a Product Manager/Owner and Web Team Manager, I am armed with the knowledge of my past experiences and continue to learn with today's current and emerging web technologies and applications. I enjoy what I do, take great pride in the quality my team (and myself) produce and the opportunity to be able to optimize websites and user experiences though proven user-centered concepts.</p>

          <p class="sectionSubtitle">Just a peek.</p>
          <p>I love music, especially the 80’s, alternative rock and electronic dance music. I'm a self-taught web &amp; ux designer and front-end developer (late nights that I'm thankful for). Consumer Behavior was my favorite core class in college. I'm a <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/" target="_blank">Bootstrap</a> enthusiast. I enjoy a cold glass of beer, whiskey, or cognac from time to time. Deserts are a weakness. I like wearing vintage design T-shirts, but I love wearing tailored suits.</p>
