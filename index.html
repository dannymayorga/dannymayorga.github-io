        <p class="sectionSubtitle">Optimizing and enhacing web and user experiences for today's web &amp; mobile applications.</p>
        <p>Hello again! My name is Danny Mayorga, I live in Miami and the Web Product Manager at Open Education. Before, I was a Web and UX designer for Aeropost, Inc. and for Karisma Hotels and Resorts. In the past decade, I've worked on enhancing user experiences for web products and services for corporate and startup environments.</p>
        <p>I find myself always listening to music form the 80's, alternative rock and elctronic dance music. They get my legs moving! I'm a self-taught front-end developer, web and ux designer, which I thank late nights for. In college, Consumer Behavior was my favorite class (graduated from Marketing) and those learnings reflect in my applciations at work, always thinking of the user / consumer. <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/" target="_blank">Bootstrap</a> enthusiast, deserts are a weakness, vintage design tees are guilty pleasure, but you can't beat a tailored suit!

          <p class="sectionSubtitle">Just a peek.</p>
          <p>I love music, especially the 80’s, alternative rock and electronic dance music. I'm a self-taught web &amp; ux designer and front-end developer (late nights that I'm thankful for). Consumer Behavior was my favorite core class in college. I'm a <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/" target="_blank">Bootstrap</a> enthusiast. I enjoy a cold glass of beer, whiskey, or cognac from time to time. Deserts are a weakness. I like wearing vintage design T-shirts, but I love wearing tailored suits.</p>
