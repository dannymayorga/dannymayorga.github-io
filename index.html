        <p>I’m currently the Web Product Manager at OpenEnglish.com and NextU.com. Open English is a leading Education SaaS platform focused on English language learning for Latin America, Brazil, U.S. Hispanic, Spain, Turkey and Russia, currently, serving over 500,000 students. NextU is a newly acquired SaaS platform to help students develop technology skills for their next steps in their career.</p>
        <p>For the past decade, I have been focused on enhancing user experiences for web products and services for corporate and startup environments. After receiving a <em>B.B.A, Marketing</em>, I started my journey into the digital world, entering as a freelancer and growing to Web Designer, UX Designer and Front-end developer. Now as a Product Manager/Owner and web team leader, I am armed with the knowledge of my past experiences and continue to learn with today's current and emerging web technologies and applications. I enjoy what I do, take great pride in the quality my team (and I) produce and the opportunity to be able to optimize websites and user experiences though proven user-centered concepts.</p>
