        <p class="sectionSubtitle">Optimizing and enhacing web and user experiences for today's web &amp; mobile applications.</p>
        <p>Hello again! I'm Danny Mayorga, Web Product Manager at Open Education. I've designed, developed web
          products and services for corporate and startup environment. Also, freelancer to smaller scale clients and been
          an adjunct lecturer for the web design certificate program at the University of Miami.</p>
        <p>
          In addition to product and project management, I'm a self-taught developer, web and UX designer. Intrigued and curious to find meaningful challanges and
          searching for knowledge with an entrepreneurial spirit. I'm an enthusiast to many forms of music (classical, 80s, alternative rock, electronic
          dance music, etc.), Consumer Behavior continues to be my favorite class in college, deserts are a weakness and vintage design tees are a guilty
          pleasure, retro love!
